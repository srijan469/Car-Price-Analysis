2. Steps of Car Price Analysis:-

        1. Defining the Goal
        3. Get the Data
        4. Explore the Data
        5. Visualize the Data
        6. Summarize Findings

# üìå INTRODUCTION OF STEPS OF ANALYZING

      ‚úÖ Defining the Goal:-
             Goal: Analyze the factor affecting car prices.
             Dataset: Data set is take from Kaggle which contains car brand, model,  year,mileage, fuel type, price , etc

      ‚úÖ Data cleaning:-
        ‚úçÔ∏è Quick checklist for Data Cleaning:
           1. Remove Duplicates
           2. Handle missing values
           3. Convert data types(if needed)
           4. Standarize column names
        
        ‚ô¶Ô∏èRemove Duplicates:-
        why? Because Duplicate rows can lead to incorrect analysis by overrepresenting data 

        ‚ô¶Ô∏èHandle missing values:
        Why? Missing values can affect calculations, so we either fill or remove them.

        ‚ô¶Ô∏èConvert Data Types:
        Why? If numbers are stored as text (string), they need conversion.

        ‚ô¶Ô∏èStandardize Column Names:
        Why? Column names should be easy to read and consistent.
     
      ‚úÖ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-
        ‚úçÔ∏è Quick checklist for EDA:-
           1. Check Basic Statistics
           2. Visualization Car Price Distribution
           3. Car Price vs Mileage
           4. verage Price by Brand
           5. rice Comparison by Car Condition

        ‚ô¶Ô∏è Check Basic Statistics
        why? summarizing of numerical columns, count the cars by brand , count of cars by body type
        
        ‚ô¶Ô∏è Visualization Car Price Distribution:
        Why? See the overall price range. which car is expensive or which is cheap
